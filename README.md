# Text Clustering with TF-IDF and Multiple Algorithms

## Overview

This Python script aims to perform text clustering on a dataset using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. Text clustering is a valuable technique in natural language processing, enabling the categorization of documents based on their content similarity. In this project, we explore three popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and Affinity Propagation, to compare their effectiveness in grouping similar textual content.

## Key Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The script utilizes the TF-IDFVectorizer from scikit-learn to transform a collection of text documents into a numerical representation that reflects the importance of words within each document.
- **Three Clustering Algorithms:** The K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and Affinity Propagation algorithms are applied to cluster the text data into groups based on content similarity.
- **Excel Output:** The results of the clustering, including the assigned clusters for each algorithm, are saved in an Excel file for further analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed and follow the instructions in the "How to Run" section. Customize the script as needed for your specific dataset, and experiment with different clustering algorithms and parameters to optimize results.
